# Semantic Search with Pinecone

This repository demonstrates how to implement semantic search using Pinecone, a vector database, alongside machine learning models for embedding generation. The goal is to create a scalable and efficient search system by leveraging vector embeddings for similarity search.

## Features

- **Vector Database**: Utilizes Pinecone for managing vector data and conducting similarity searches.
- **Embedding Generation**: Integrates pre-trained machine learning models for generating semantic embeddings from text data.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets with ease.
- **Flexible Querying**: Provides a semantic search interface for more accurate and meaningful search results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- [Pinecone API Key](https://www.pinecone.io/)
- A machine learning model for embedding generation (e.g., Hugging Face transformers)

### Dependencies

The required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
